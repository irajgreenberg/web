    <h1>Protobyte Library Examples</h1>
    <p>Description: These image was created using the Protobyte library. Particles were emitted toward some 3D geometry and allowed to collide with the geometry surfaces. At the conclusion of the collisions, the particles were connected forming paths. New arterial geometry was then extruded along the paths with applied texture and image maps and lighting.</p>
